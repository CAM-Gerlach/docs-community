===================================
CPython Documentation Working Group
===================================

Purpose & Common Goals
----------------------

This workgroup supports efforts to improve
and maintain CPython's documentation through curation,
internationalization, and special projects. Its focus also includes
tutorials, how-to documents, the devguide and other documentation in support
of the PSF's mission to expand the global Python userbase.
Quality and effectiveness are our key goals as we build a
diverse team of community members, documentarians, and core developers.

Things the workgroup could do:

- Develop the governance model for docs
- Be the steering council for docs
- Be the authors of doc guidelines
- Be the authors/editors of docs
- Request grant funding from PSF, if needed
- Form an editorial board for docs including core devs, educators, and
  documentarians in the Python community

Active Time
-----------

This workgroup will be active indefinitely while supported by the Python
Steering Council.

Core Values & Internal Governance
---------------------------------

The core values for this group are:

- Respect
- Support
- Positive Atmosphere
- Constructiveness
- Integrity

The workgroup adopts the `PSF Code of Conduct <https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/>`_.
Any action by a workgroup member, as decided by a majority of the group,
that violates the principles in the Code of Conduct will result in that member
being removed from the workgroup.

Rules & Guidelines
------------------

- At its discretion, the Python Steering Council may add any number
  of non-voting observers to the working group to participate in discussion.
- The group's remit includes the Sphinx documentation included in the Python
  source repository, including the `Python Docs Sphinx Theme
  <https://github.com/python/python-docs-theme>`,
  as well as separate projects such
  as the developer guide. Translations and infrastructure will be managed by
  the Steering Council-appointed Internationalisation Lead,
  currently Julien Palard.
- The group will also maintain documentation of meetings and best practices.
- The editorial board will include people outside of the core developers who are
  tech writers or educators.

Decision-Making Procedures
--------------------------

Decisions will be made using the voting procedures outlined below. Anyone may
propose or request a topic for a decision.

In general, a topic for decision should address one of the workgroup's goals:

- Improve or maintain the state of Python's documentation effort by some
  noticeable or measurable amount.
- Increase the participation of contributors to documentation.

To be considered for membership, prospective members must send an
email introducing themselves, along with a description of why they want to be
a member and what they bring to the group. Approval of new members will be
decided using the voting procedures detailed below.

Voting
~~~~~~

A vote for any proposal will last for 7 days, or when all voting members have
voted, whichever comes first. For a proposal to be successful, it must have at
least two +1's, more +1's than -0's, and no -1. Votes may be held in any venue
agreed to by all voting members.

Communication Plan
------------------

The working group will communicate via the
`Documentation category <https://discuss.python.org/tags/c/core-dev/documentation>`_
on `Discourse <https://discuss.python.org>`_.

The existing `Doc-SIG mailing list <https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/doc-sig>`_
will continue, but will not be the primary
communication method for the workgroup or for recruiting additional contributors.
From time to time, the working group may post announcements, such as meeting
details, to the Doc-SIG list.

The group will also meet on a regular basis to discuss the state of Python's
documentation. Topics might include:

- The size of the documentation PR backlog, whether it's growing or shrinking,
  and what to do about it.
- Which parts of the documentation require updating most urgently.
- New documents/sections that should be created to meet community needs.

Budget
------

The working group will not require a dedicated budget in its initial phase.
If needed, the working group may ask the board of directors for any funds needed
(for meetings, writers, translators, software development, etc.).

Participants
------------

The Python Steering Council are permanent members of this working group.
The initial workgroup members are:

- Carol Willing
- Ned Batchelder
- Mariatta Wijaya
- Julien Palard (Lead, Infrastructure/Localization)

The working group may have up to 20 members,
of which at least a quarter must not be core developers.

The workgroup members will act as the editorial board for the Python
documentation and make decisions on controversial content, if needed.

Although not part of this workgroup, a Documentation Team will also be created.
The Documentation Team will be regular contributors to the CPython
documentation and attend the monthly meetings (synchronously or asynchronously).
The goal of this team will be to build a global community around the
CPython documentation.
